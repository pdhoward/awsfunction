# AWS Function

Netlify functions are deployed to AWS, but the platform provides a number of utilities to simplify the process of managing, testing and deploying functions

This is a simple example of a function that can be tested locally and deployed to netlify

> npm run dev   // starts the netlify function server on port 9000
> node test/server // starts server on port 4000
> open browser
